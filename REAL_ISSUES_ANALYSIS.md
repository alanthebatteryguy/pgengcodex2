# Real Issues Analysis

## 1. The Console Logs Are Stale
The console logs show stress calculations that don't match the current code. This means we're looking at output from BEFORE the recent code changes.

## 2. The Actual Problems

### Problem 1: Eccentricity Too Small
- For 5" slab: emax = 5/2 - 1.5 - 0.5 = 0.5"
- With eRatio starting at 0.6: e = 0.3"
- This is TINY and requires massive prestress force

### Problem 2: High Prestress Forces
- To balance moment with small e: P = M/e
- With M = 50,700 in-lb and e = 0.3": P = 169,000 lbs/ft
- This creates excessive compression: -P/A = -2,817 psi alone!

### Problem 3: All Combinations Failing
- The logs show 8,050 attempts ALL failed stress transfer checks
- This suggests systemic issues, not just parameter tuning

## 3. Root Causes

### Issue 1: Minimum Thickness Too Low
- 5" is too thin for 26-30 ft spans
- Rule of thumb: thickness â‰ˆ span/180 to span/240
- For 26 ft: thickness should be 1.3" to 1.7" (way too thin!)
- For parking garages: typically use span/45 to span/55
- For 26 ft: thickness should be 5.7" to 6.9" minimum

### Issue 2: Load Balancing Philosophy
- Trying to balance 60-110% of dead load
- With thin slabs, this requires excessive prestress
- Modern practice: balance 80-100% of SUSTAINED loads only

### Issue 3: Eccentricity Limits
- Cover + 0.5" for strand diameter is eating up eccentricity
- For 5" slab, only 0.5" max eccentricity available
- Need thicker slabs for reasonable eccentricity

## 4. Solutions

1. **Increase minimum thickness based on span**
   ```javascript
   const minThickness = Math.max(5, Math.ceil(bayLength * 12 / 50));
   ```

2. **Check if span is reasonable for flat plate**
   - Flat plates typically limited to 30-35 ft
   - Beyond that, need beams

3. **Review prestress levels**
   - Current code tries to achieve 175 psi minimum
   - This might be excessive for some spans

4. **Fix eccentricity calculation**
   - Current: emax = h/2 - cover - 0.5
   - Should consider actual strand diameter and spacing
