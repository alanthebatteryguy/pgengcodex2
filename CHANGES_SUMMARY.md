# Summary of Changes Made

## 1. Implemented Span-Based Minimum Thickness
- **Flat plate**: `minThickness = Math.max(5, Math.ceil((bayLength * 12) / 50))`
  - Based on span/45 to span/55 rule for parking garages
  - Ensures 5" minimum per ACI 362.1R
  
- **One-way beam**: `minSlabThickness = Math.max(4, Math.ceil((clearSpan * 12) / 180))`
  - Based on span/180 for continuous one-way slabs
  
- **Two-way beam**: `minSlabThickness = Math.max(3, Math.ceil((shortSpan * 12) / 200))`
  - Based on span/200 for two-way slabs

## 2. Fixed Eccentricity Calculations
- Added explicit strand diameter variables
- Added checks to skip if eccentricity < 0.5" (one-way) or < 1.0" (flat plate)
- More accurate eccentricity: `emax = thickness/2 - cover - strandDiameter/2`

## 3. Improved Logging
- Added console logs showing thickness being tried for each span
- Added periodic logging every 100 attempts
- Shows when designs are skipped due to insufficient eccentricity

## 4. Key Insights from Analysis
- 5" slab was too thin for 26-30 ft spans
- Eccentricity of 0.3" was causing excessive prestress requirements
- All 8,050 attempts were failing stress transfer checks
- Console logs were from before code changes took effect

## 5. Sign Convention (Maintained Correct)
- Compression is negative
- Prestress formula: `-P/A ± P*e/S ± M/S`
- Top fiber: compression from P/A, varies from Pe, compression from +M
- Bottom fiber: compression from P/A, varies from Pe, tension from +M

## Next Steps
- Test with actual project to see if designs now succeed
- Monitor console output to verify thickness iteration works
- Check if stress transfer failures reduce with proper thickness selection
