# Rebar Optimization Evaluation

## Current Approach

The system calculates minimum required rebar based on:
1. Temperature/shrinkage (ACI 7.6.1): 0.0018 for Grade 60
2. Minimum bonded (ACI 8.6.1): Based on cracking moment
3. Two-way PT requirements (ACI 24.4.3): Based on span and stress

Takes the governing (maximum) of these three.

## Proposed Rebar Optimization Analysis

### Cost Comparison
- PT strand: $1.15/lb installed (per costParams.ptStrandCostPerLb)
- Mild steel: $1.20/lb installed (per costParams.mildSteelCostPerLb)
- **Only 4% difference in cost per pound**

### Efficiency Comparison

**PT Strand (270 ksi):**
- Ultimate strength: 270,000 psi
- Effective stress: ~190,000 psi (after losses)
- Very efficient use of material

**Mild Steel (Grade 60):**
- Yield strength: 60,000 psi
- Design stress: 60,000 psi
- Only 31% as strong as PT strand

### Weight Comparison for Same Force

To provide 100 lbs of force:
- PT: 100 / 190,000 = 0.000526 sq in
- Rebar: 100 / 60,000 = 0.00167 sq in
- **Rebar needs 3.2x more area**

Cost for 100 lbs force over 30 ft span:
- PT: 0.000526 × 490 lb/cy × 30 ft × $1.15 = $8.90
- Rebar: 0.00167 × 490 × 30 × $1.20 = $29.46
- **Rebar costs 3.3x more for same force**

### When Would More Rebar Make Sense?

1. **Never for primary moment resistance** - PT is always more efficient
2. **Potentially for crack control** - But minimums usually sufficient
3. **For seismic ductility** - But covered by code minimums

### Strain Compatibility Issues

As rebar increases beyond ~0.003 ratio:
- Concrete crushes before rebar yields fully
- Diminishing returns on added capacity
- Congestion makes placement difficult

### Real-World Constraints

**Practical rebar limits:**
- Single layer: ρ ≤ 0.004 (already double the minimum)
- Beyond this requires multiple layers
- Increases labor cost significantly
- May require thicker sections for cover

### Optimization Implementation Analysis

```typescript
// Theoretical optimization loop
for (let rebarRatio = minRequired; rebarRatio <= 0.004; rebarRatio += 0.0002) {
  // Calculate moment capacity with this rebar
  const rebarMoment = calculateRebarMoment(rebarRatio, fy, d);
  
  // Reduce required PT moment
  const ptMomentRequired = totalMoment - rebarMoment;
  
  // Calculate costs
  const rebarCost = rebarRatio * area * weight * $1.20;
  const ptCost = calculatePTForMoment(ptMomentRequired) * $1.15;
  
  // Problem: PT is ~3x more efficient, so this never optimizes to more rebar
}
```

### Case Study: 30' Span, 8" Slab

**Minimum Rebar Design:**
- Rebar: 0.0018 ratio = $0.80/sf
- PT: 180 psi = $3.50/sf
- Total: $4.30/sf

**Double Rebar Design:**
- Rebar: 0.0036 ratio = $1.60/sf
- PT: ~165 psi = $3.20/sf (small reduction)
- Total: $4.80/sf
- **Result: 12% MORE expensive**

### Special Cases Considered

1. **High seismic zones**: Code already requires more rebar
2. **Corrosive environments**: More rebar doesn't help (corrodes too)
3. **Fire resistance**: PT typically governs, not rebar
4. **Construction simplicity**: More rebar = more complexity

## Verdict: NOT WORTH IMPLEMENTING

### Reasons:

1. **Economics Don't Work**
   - PT is 3x more efficient per dollar
   - Adding rebar always increases total cost
   - No optimization sweet spot exists

2. **Minimal Design Impact**
   - Code minimums are usually adequate
   - Extra rebar provides marginal benefit
   - Strain compatibility limits effectiveness

3. **Practical Issues**
   - Congestion above ρ = 0.003
   - Increased labor for placement
   - No contractor preference for this

4. **Current Approach is Correct**
   - Calculate minimums per code
   - These minimums are well-established
   - No evidence that more is beneficial

### Alternative Consideration

Instead of optimizing rebar amount, consider:
- Optimizing rebar SIZE (#4 vs #5 vs #6) for constructability
- Optimizing SPACING for crack control
- But these are detailing issues, not design optimization

## Recommendation

❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** rebar optimization beyond code minimums.

The current approach of calculating and using code-minimum reinforcement is correct both theoretically and practically. The small cost difference between PT and rebar, combined with PT's superior efficiency, means there's no economic optimization opportunity here.

Focus optimization efforts on:
1. ✅ Concrete strength selection
2. ✅ Load balancing ratios
3. ✅ System selection (flat plate vs beams)

These offer real, quantifiable savings. Rebar optimization does not.
